What command(s) can we use to find the distribution of the system installed on the server?

lsb_release -a
hostnamectl
cat /etc/os-release

uname -r to find out the kernel version


1.2 Explain the permissions of the folder /tmp/exercise_1

By accessing tmp folder using cd/tmp and then using ls -lah we can see the list of files and folders inside /tmp and the permissions attached to them.
For folder exercise_1 the permissions are: drwxr-sr --

d : which means exercise_1 is a directory and the absence of it means it's a regular file.
r : Read : considering it's a directory it means we can ls the directory (if it was a file it means we can read it)
w : Write :  considering it's a directory it means we can modify its contents (if it was a file it means we can write it)
x : Execute :  considering it's a directory it means we can cd to the directory (if it was a file it means we can execute it)

so the first rwx are linked to the owner permissions (root) which means the root can read , write and execute and the second ones that come the - (sr) are group permissions

s : SUID , set user id , which means set userid on execution or in this case set group id , execute the programe with the id of its owner.
r : group memebers can read the file , considering it's a directroy , it means ls the directory
